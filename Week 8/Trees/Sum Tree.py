Sum Tree

Given a Binary Tree. Check whether it is a Sum Tree or not.

A Binary Tree is a Sum Tree in which value of each node x is equal to sum of nodes present in its left subtree and right subtree . An empty tree is also a Sum Tree as sum of an empty tree can be considered to be 0. A leaf node is also considered as a Sum Tree.

Example 1:

Input:
    3
  /   \    
 1     2

Output: 1
Explanation: The given tree is a sum 
tree so return a boolean true.

Example 2:

Input:

          10
        /    \
      20      30
    /   \ 
   10    10

Output: 0
Explanation: The given tree is not a sum
tree. For the root node, sum of elements
in left subtree is 40 and sum of elements
in right subtree is 30. Root element = 10
which is not equal to 30+40.

Your Task: 
You dont need to read input or print anything. Complete the function isSumTree() which takes root node as input parameter and returns true if the tree is a SumTree else it returns false.
 

Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(Height of the Tree)


Constraints:
1 ≤ number of nodes ≤ 104

Solution:

'''
class Node:
    def __init__(self, val):
        self.right = None
        self.data = val
        self.left = None
'''
# your task is to complete this function
# function should return True is Tree is SumTree else return False
def isleaf(root):
    if root is None:
        return 0
    if root.left is None and root.right is None:
        return 1
    return 0

def isSumTree(root):
    # Code here
    if root is None or isleaf(root):
        return 1
    ls = rs = 0
    if isSumTree(root.left) and isSumTree(root.right):
        if root.left is None:
            ls = 0
        elif isleaf(root.left):
            ls = root.left.data
        else:
            ls = 2*root.left.data

        if root.right is None:
            rs = 0
        elif isleaf(root.right):
            rs = root.right.data
        else:
            rs =2*root.right.data
        return root.data==ls+rs
    return 0
