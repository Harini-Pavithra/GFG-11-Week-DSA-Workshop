Determine if Two Trees are Identical 

Given two binary trees, the task is to find if both of them are identical or not. 

Example 1:

Input:
     1          1
   /   \      /   \
  2     3    2     3
Output: Yes
Explanation: There are two trees both
having 3 nodes and 2 edges, both trees
are identical having the root as 1,
left child of 1 is 2 and right child
of 1 is 3.
Example 2:

Input:
    1       1
  /  \     /  \
 2    3   3    2
Output: No
Explanation: There are two trees both
having 3 nodes and 2 edges, but both
trees are not identical.
Your task:
Since this is a functional problem you don't have to worry about input, you just have to complete the function isIdentical() that takes two roots as parameters and returns true or false. The printing is done by the driver code.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(Height of the Tree).

Constraints:
1 <= Number of nodes <= 1000
1 <=Data of a node <= 1000

Solution:

#User function Template for python3

'''
class Node:
    def _init_(self, val):
        self.right = None
        self.data = val
        self.left = None
'''
# your task is to complete this function
# function should return true/false or 1/0

def isIdentical(root1, root2):
    
    # base case when both roots are null
    if root1 is None and root2 is None:
        return 1
    
    # if not null
    # then compare the data of both the root
    # and then recurse for left child of both the trees
    # and right child of both the trees
    if root1 is not None and root2 is not None:
        return (root1.data==root2.data) and isIdentical(root1.left, root2.left) and isIdentical(root1.right, root2.right)
