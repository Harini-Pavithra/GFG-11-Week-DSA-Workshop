Reverse a Linked List in groups of given size. 

Given a linked list of size N. The task is to reverse every k nodes (where k is an input to the function) in the linked list.

Example 1:

Input:
LinkedList: 1->2->2->4->5->6->7->8
K = 4
Output: 4 2 2 1 8 7 6 5 
Explanation: 
The first 4 elements 1,2,2,4 are reversed first 
and then the next 4 elements 5,6,7,8. Hence, the 
resultant linked list is 4->2->2->1->8->7->6->5.
Example 2:

Input:
LinkedList: 1->2->3->4->5
K = 3
Output: 3 2 1 5 4 
Explanation: 
The first 3 elements are 1,2,3 are reversed 
first and then elements 4,5 are reversed.Hence, 
the resultant linked list is 3->2->1->5->4.
Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function reverse() which should reverse the linked list in group of size k and return the head of the modified linked list.

Expected Time Complexity : O(N)
Expected Auxilliary Space : O(1)

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 103
1 <= k <= N

Solution

"""Return reference of new head of the reverse linked list
  The input list will have at least one element
  Node is defined as

class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
		self.data = data
		self.next = None
  This is method only submission.
  You only need to complete the method.
