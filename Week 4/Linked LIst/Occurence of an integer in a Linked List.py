Occurence of an integer in a Linked List 

Given a singly linked list and a key, count the number of occurrences of given key in the linked list.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 7
Link List = 1->2->1->2->1->3->1
search_for = 1
Output: 4
Explanation:1 appears 4 times.
 

Your Task:

You dont need to read input or print anything. Complete the function count() which takes the head of the link list and search_for i.e- the key as input parameters and returns the count of occurrences of the given key.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
0 â‰¤ N â‰¤ 10^4

Solution

"""  Return the no. of times search_for value is there in a linked list.
  The input list will have at least one element
  Node is defined as

class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
		self.data = data
		self.next = None
  This is method only submission.
  You only need to complete the method.
